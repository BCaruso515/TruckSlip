Truck Tickets is an app that I developed as a hobbyist developer. This app is merely a project that I developed using an idea that could improve efficiency from my real-life job. This app, without modification, is unlikely to be useful to anyone. The source code is available to the public on GitHub (https://github.com/BCaruso515/TruckSlip) Feel free to make any modifiacation necessary to make this app useful for you.
